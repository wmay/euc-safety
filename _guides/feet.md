When it comes to feet, the worry is less about hitting something and more about
the wheel hitting *you*. It's common for a pedal to hit you on the back of the
foot or ankle when your foot accidentally ends up in front of it. And because
the pedal is attached directly to the wheel it can hit with an impressive amount
of force.

For smaller wheels a lot of the damage -- mostly minor scrapes -- can be avoided
just by wearing high-top shoes with padded collars. That could mean, for
example, Vans Sk8-Hi shoes, or hiking shoes or boots.

Heavier wheels may call for additional protection. Motorcycle shoes are one
option, since they often come with ankle impact protectors. The TCX Street Ace
shoes are an example. Most motorcycle shoes are also made with abrasion
resistant materials, so that they aren't shredded by asphalt.

One shortcoming of motorcycle shoes is that they don't have as much impact
protection on the back of your foot, at least not above the heel. Motorcycle
racing boots or motocross boots probably provide more protection, but they're
expensive and kind of awkward. The Japanese motorcycle gear company Komine makes
a more convenient alternative, the [SK-481 Ankle
Protector](https://japan.webike.net/products/20127444.html). (Though at the
moment I'm the only person I know of who's tried it.)
