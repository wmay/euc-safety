# Overview

There is no single best way to fall. It depends on how you're falling, what gear
you're wearing, and how fast you're going.

Many crashes don't allow the rider to choose how to fall. The typical forward
fall (aka faceplant) may be the worst in this regard. Due to a lack of better
options in that situation, you should catch yourself with your hands to make
sure you don't land directly on your face.

If you do have the chance to choose your fall, you should plan to fall on
something that isn't your hands, because falling on hands is a common cause of
wrist, elbow, and shoulder injuries (sometimes called FOOSH injuries). If you're
wearing kneepads, sliding on knees is a safer alternative, and a parachute
landing fall is another decent option. Before falling you also want to crouch
down so that you don't have as far to fall.

The worst advice I see is "just go limp," which is absolutely wrong. It's a
myth.

# The faceplant pushup

Faceplants don't offer a lot of options. A 2 meter fall happens in less than 2/3
of a second. Often the rider is already leaning forward to accelerate at the
start of the crash, so there's very little time to react before hitting the
ground. By the time you're aware that you're falling, there's no time to roll.

The best thing to do in that scenario is to catch yourself with your
hands. There just isn't a better option. You will appreciate having good
[wrist]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/hands.md %}) and [elbow]({{
site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/impact.md %}) protection when this happens.

If your elbows are locked, the impact can damage your shoulders. So make sure
your elbows are bent, kind of like you're doing a pushup.

# Falling strategies

If you have time to plan a fall, you might want to try one of these
strategies. The main ideas are to lower yourself so that you'll fall a shorter
distance, avoid catching yourself with your hands, and find a way to spread out
the impact.

None of these will work in every situation.

## The knee slide

The safest way to fall is to land on your knees. This avoids hitting your head
and upper body altogether, as well as hands and arms, which are relatively easy
to hurt. (This is a good reason to wear [knee pads]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
_guides/impact.md %}).)

Ivo from the This Is Soul skate shop explains the idea here:

Having a wheel between your legs makes this more awkward on an EUC than on
skates, but it's a good choice if you can do it.

## Rolling

Rolling has outspoken advocates who like to point to advice for activities like
parkour. See [this video](https://youtu.be/tUJwUUAiT4o) for example. I don't
think rolling works as well on unicycles as it does for parkour, though it's
still a decent option.

One useful roll in particular is the [parachute landing
fall](https://youtu.be/PiLyqGu2XKI). The idea is to spread out the impact by
hitting (in sequence) your feet, calf, thigh, hip/butt, and then back. This
seems like one of the safer ways to fall sideways.

Here's why I don't think rolling works as well on unicycles as it does for other
sports:

1. There are safer alternatives if you're wearing proper gear (i.e. sliding on
   kneepads),
2. The standing position on a unicycle is relatively awkward to roll out of,
   especially for forward rolls, and
3. Rolling at high speeds can lead to chaotic tumbling. For example, compare the
   relaxed slide in this video at 1:54 with the chaotic tumble at 3:02:

But there are still many cases where rolling makes sense. I specifically
recommend rolling when crashing at low speed with no gear. (If you crash at
*high* speed with no gear, then your choices will be to slide and get road rash,
or roll and risk injuring yourself in a tumble. Don't put yourself in that
situation.)

# Don't go limp-- it's a myth

I regularly see advice to go limp in a crash. I tried to find the source of this
claim, and what I ultimately found was nothing. It's just a myth.

The myth seems to have originated with data on car crashes, where drunk drivers
are said to be more likely to survive due to their drunken relaxation. This
claim has been repeated endlessly. But it's not true.

The claim was already considered a myth by experts as far back as
1995.[^latimes] More recently, in 2012, Lee Friedman studied the relationship
between alcohol and traumatic injuries, and said that the claim is "probably
grossly overestimated and false."[^friedman] And a 2013 study of car crash
patients found that "Alcohol consumption does not protect patients from
sustaining severe injuries nor does it shorten the length of hospital
stay."[^hsieh]

So don't go limp. Bracing for impact is correct.
