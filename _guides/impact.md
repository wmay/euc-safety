# Overview

Riders often hit knees, elbows, and hips in a fall, so it's a good idea to
protect these. Ribs and shoulders are hit less often, but it can be a good idea
to protect them as well.

Skateboard/rollerblade and motorcycle pads work best. Of the two, skateboard
pads provide high levels of protection for smaller impacts, while motorcycle
pads provide more minimal protection but for harder impacts. Therefore heavier
people, who will hit the ground with more force, should lean toward motorcycle
pads, while lighter people may find that skateboard pads work better for them.

Among motorcycle pads, off-road pads with hard shells and the on-road pads in
motorcycle clothing are both good choices, assuming the pads stay in
place.

Motorcycle pads are usually certified as CE level 1 or level 2. Level 1 pads
provide minimal levels of protection. I recommend level 2 for upper body
protectors.

Third-party sellers on sites like Amazon and AliExpress often lie about safety
certifications and use fake impact protectors. The fakers include popular brands
HWK and Viking Cycle. User ratings on these sites mislead due to fake reviews
and poorly informed buyers. I recommend getting gear from reputable sellers like
RevZilla and Cycle Gear. See more about fakes from Fake Britain (on [leather
jackets](https://youtu.be/JgygN5sNUWs), [helmets](https://youtu.be/mdWvU9RF5ew),

At higher speeds it's a good idea to switch to [abrasion resistant motorcycle
clothing]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/abrasion.md %}) with internal
pads. Not only will this clothing protect you from road rash, it will also hold
the pads in place during a slide.

# Roller sports vs motorcycle standards

Motorcycle protectors are usually CE certified, even though the certification is
only required in Europe. Skateboard and rollerblade pads can also be CE
certified, under the EN 14120 "roller sport" standard, though it's less common
outside of Europe.

Here's a video demonstrating some of the motorcycle protector testing:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K69_aYeRPOA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Both styles of protector can be certified as either level 1 or level 2 depending
on how well they absorb impacts, with level 2 pads providing more
protection. For motorcycle protectors, level 2 pads transmit less force in
response to a test impact. In the tables below, the Joules (J) is the energy of
the test impact, and the kiloNewtons (kN) is the amount of force transmitted to
a sensor under the pad.

Before looking at the standards, though, I want to provide a sense of what a
kiloNewton is and what different amounts of kiloNewtons might feel like. Here
are a few examples along with their approximate kiloNewtons of force[^kilonewtons]:

[^kilonewtons]: These examples are taken from [Brute Force: Humans Can Sure Take
    a Punch](https://www.livescience.com/6040-brute-force-humans-punch.html) and
    [What does 1 newton of force feel
    like?](https://wikipedikia.org/what-does-1-newton-of-force-feel-like-12/).

| Example                             | approximate kN |
|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Hard push                           | 1              |
| Punch in amateur boxing             | 2.5            |
| Hard punch by a professional boxer  | 5              |
| Hard kick by a professional fighter | 9              |

And here are the CE requirements for motorcycle protectors:

| Body Part               | Impact (J) | Level 1 Force (kN) | Level 2 Force (kN) |
|-------------------------|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Elbow/Knee/Shoulder/Hip | 50         | 35                 | 20                 |
| Back                    | 50         | 18                 | 9                  |
| Chest                   | 50         | 18                 | 15                 |

The 50 Joules impact in these requirements is a 5kg weight dropped 1 meter. In
response to this realistic impact, the requirements allow motorcycle protectors
to transmit large amounts of force. Even level 2 motorcycle pads can transmit
more force than a kick from a professional fighter, though they should be less
jarring than the level 1 pads.

For those who aren't prepared to take this kind of beating, companies like
Forcefield, SAS-TEC, and D3O make premium pads that far surpass the level 2
requirements. You can also reduce the force by doubling the pads[^doubling].

[^doubling]: See [Assessing the performance of motorcyclistsâ€™ impact protectors
    in simulated ATD knee and shoulder
    impacts](https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2018.1540867).

For roller sports, level 2 pads transmit the same amount of force as level 1
pads, but in response to harder impacts. (As of October 2021, I only know of
kneepads that meet the level 2 requirements.)

| Body Part | Level 1 Impact (J) | Level 2 Impact (J) | Force (kN) |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|------------|
| Knee      | 12                 | 25                 | 6          |
| Elbow     | 6                  | 15                 | 4          |
| Palm      | 5                  | 10                 | 3          |

These tables show that, as far as European standards are concerned, roller
sports pads are designed to absorb smaller impacts than motorcycle pads. They
also cushion the impacts much more than motorcycle pads.

# On-road vs off-road motorcycle protectors

People sometimes claim that off-road motorcycle gear is better than on-road gear
for impact protection, but that's not true in general. They're both subject to
the same CE impact standards. Off-road gear often comes with CE level 1 impact
protection, while it's easy to find motorcycle jackets and pants with higher, CE
level 2 protection. Instead, on- and off-road pads are each better for certain
types of impacts, and with lots of variation within each category.

What distinguishes on- and off-road gear is that off-road gear sometimes covers
a larger surface area, and often comes with a hard outer shell. The greater
surface area is good for falling on uneven terrain, and the hard shells prevent
penetration and protect the pads from branches etc.

In contrast, on-road protectors are often made of viscoelastic materials that
mold to your body and harden on impact. Ryan from FortNine demonstrates some
viscoelastic pads in this video:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hA3ww6Sr5-M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Aside from comfort, the benefit of on-road protectors is that the motorcycle
clothing they come in is more likely to hold together in a high-speed crash. A
pad doesn't do much good after it slides out of place.

# What good is a hard shell?

Hard shells don't absorb impacts, but they're included with pads for a variety
of reasons:

*Abrasion resistance and sliding.* Hard shells can protect against damage from a
punishing brush against asphalt. Since the shells are relatively slippery, they
also make it easier for the pad to stay in place in a fall. These are the
primary reasons why skateboard pads have hard shells.

*Penetration resistance.* Hard shells can also prevent sharp objects from
penetrating through the pad, and distribute their impact across a larger surface
area. This is why hard shells are common in off-road gear.

*Impact distribution.* Aside from dulling the impact of sharp objects, hard
shells can strategically distribute impacts across large surface areas and away
from fragile body parts. Helmets and wrist guards use hard shells this way. Some
kneepads, chest, and back protectors also do this.

# Detailed notes

## Knees/shins

Many riders choose motocross-style knee/shin guards (such as the Leatt Dual
Axis). Aside from protecting your knees, they also protect your shins from
painful knocks against the wheel. This style of knee guard might also be less
likely to slide away during a crash at higher speeds than a smaller
skateboard-style knee pad.

Hard shell pads can redirect impacts away from kneecaps, which is sometimes an
awkward place to hit, so some people prefer them to viscoelastic knee pads.

Motocross knee braces provide even more protection, at a much higher price. My
understanding is that these are meant to prevent your knees from
overextending. I haven't seen an instance of that on an EUC, so I don't think
these are necessary unless you have pre-existing knee problems.

## Elbows

Skateboard and motorcycle elbow pads are both good options.

## Hips

Hip pads usually come in the form of impact shorts or as protectors contained in
motorcycle pants. There are also a few external pads available ([Demon
United](https://demon-united.com/products/hip-belt-x-d3o),
[Komine](http://komineshop.shop21.makeshop.jp/shopdetail/000000000053)).

## Shoulders

Shoulders are a weak spot, so I recommend getting a high level of shoulder
impact protection.

For motorcycle purposes, shoulder protecters are classified as limb protectors
and tested with a 5kg weight meant to be similar to the weight of an
arm. Unfortunately, if you fall onto your shoulder with the weight of your
entire torso, that's not enough protection. Too many riders have crashed this
way, leading to bad shoulder injuries.

An [informal
survey](https://forum.electricunicycle.org/topic/27058-euc-broken-shoulder-survey/)
of broken shoulders on the EUC forums suggests that these injuries can happen
even at lower speeds.

The only protector that can reliably protect shoulders in this type of crash is
the Alpinestars Tech Air airbag vest. It's an expensive solution, but it could
easily be worth the expense.

## Chest/ribs

Rib injuries can happen when the wheel yanks sideways, causing the rider to fall
on his or her side, or when the wheel loses traction in a turn.

Motorcycle chest protectors provide some rib protection, though they cover more
of the front and often leave the sides exposed. I haven't heard of anyone
breaking a rib while wearing motorcycle chest protectors, so it's not clear how
much of a problem that may be.

A hard shell is a good idea for these pads because the shell spreads impacts
across a wide surface area. The motorcycle level 2 certification for chest
protectors tests the rigidity of the pads for this reason.

There are alternatives to the traditional motorcycle chest protectors, though
it's not obvious that they're needed:

- Very strong rib protectors are made for karting (as in, go-kart racing). These
  are almost the reverse of motorcycle protectors-- they provide excellent side
  protection but usually leave the front more exposed.
- Horse riding vests provide very high levels of impact protection over the
  entire torso, with the downside of additional bulk. Tekrider makes a slightly
  slimmed down version (the Tekvest) specifically for motorcyclists.
- Airbag vests provide the ultimate torso protection, far beyond any pads.

## Back

Backward falls seem to be less common and relatively gentle when they occur. So,
although back protectors are popular in motorcycle gear, it's not obvious that
back protection is needed for EUC riders. (An exception might be if you're
riding backwards.)

However, it may be useful to have a back protector regardless, since it can
serve as an added layer of [abrasion resistance]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
_guides/abrasion.md %}).
