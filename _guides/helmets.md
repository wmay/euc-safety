# Overview

Most experienced EUC riders say that a full face helmet (that is, a helmet with
a chin bar) is the way to go. However, there are multiple types of full face
helmet to choose from, and different types are better suited to different types
of riding and different riding speeds.

There are two main choices to make:

1. Do you want an on-road or off-road helmet?
1. What level of impact protection do you want? (Motorcycle helmets provide the
   highest level of protection.)

The table below shows the style of helmet corresponding to each combination of
answers:

|              | Non-motorcycle        | Motorcycle         |
|              | --------------        | ----------         |
| **On-road**  | Downhill longboarding | On-road motorcycle |
| **Off-road** | Mountain bike         | Motocross          |

On-road helmets are probably better for cooler weather and higher speeds. As for
protection, these are the minimum recommended levels of impact protection based
on riding speed:

| Helmet type                   | Speed (mph) | Certifications         |
| -----------                   | ----------- | --------------         |
| Bicycle                       | <20         | CPSC, EN 1078          |
| Downhill Mountain Bike Racing | 20-28       | ASTM F1952             |
| Motorcycle                    | >28         | DOT, ECE, Snell, SHARP |

The reasoning behind these recommendations is explained further down.

# On-road vs off-road

The face shields on on-road helmets keep bugs/dirt/tree pollen/dust/rain out of
your face better than glasses or goggles can. At higher speeds even rain becomes
surprisingly painful, so this is a big plus.

But the convenience comes with potential downsides, as the face shields also
keep out wind and road noise. Generally, on-road helmets are hotter and quieter
than off-road helmets, and people sometimes claim that on-road helmets have
poorer peripheral vision.

**Hotter:** Due to the visor blocking airflow, on-road helmets get hotter than
off-road helmets.
  
**Quieter:** (hearing research)

**Poorer peripheral vision?**

# How much protection?

The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) suggests that bicycle helmets
can be appropriate for motorized scooters moving slower than 20mph (see footnote
4 of [their helmet
guide](https://www.cpsc.gov/safety-education/safety-guides/sports-fitness-and-recreation-bicycles/which-helmet-which-activity)). There
are many full face bicycle helmets, like the Demon Podium and the O'Neal
Backflip, that fall into this category. So, for example, if you ride an InMotion
V8, which has a top speed of 18mph, this kind of helmet is probably fine.

For protection at higher speeds, many riders opt for helmets certified for
downhill mountain bike racing (ASTM F1952). Examples are the Fox Proframe and
the TSG Pass. These helmets are subject to higher impact requirements and are
meant for the faster speeds of downhill racers. The downhill standard doesn't
explicitly specify a range of speeds, though, which has created some
confusion. For example, the
[electric-scooter.guide](https://electric-scooter.guide/safety/ultimate-guide-electric-scooter-helmets/)
website says these helmets are only intended for speeds <20mph, the same as
regular bicycle helmets. Meanwhile Adam from [Wrong
Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppD9gOEudcw&t=274s) suggests they're
appropriate up to 50-60kph (31-37mph).[^wrongway]

[^wrongway]: In the video he only discusses helmets with a regular bicycle
    certification. I'm not sure why he ignores downhill-rated helmets.
	
To clear up the confusion, I compare the downhill standard with two other
standards intermediate between bikes and motorcycles: Snell's L-98 standard for
moped helmets and the Dutch NTA standard for e-bike helmets. The Snell L-98
standard is meant for vehicles traveling below highway speeds, while the NTA
e-bike standard is meant for e-bikes traveling up to 28mph (the legal top speed
for e-bikes in the Netherlands). Unfortunately, as of August 2021, there are no
full face helmets with these certifications, but at least we can use them for
comparison.

Many helmet standards, including these, use a common impact testing scheme,
which involves dropping a dummy head in a helmet onto an anvil and measuring the
acceleration of the head during the impact. If the acceleration exceeds a
threshold, usually around 300 G's, then the helmet fails the test. This video
shows a helmet undergoing the certification tests:

The downhill racing, moped, and e-bike standards all have similar impact
requirements. Snell's moped standard seems to have the highest requirements,
followed closely by the NTA e-bike standard, with ASTM's downhill racing
standard slightly below that. Following the NTA's guidance, since the downhill
certification's requirements are slightly lower than e-bike requirements,
downhill helmets would also be appropriate for speeds up to 28mph at the
highest, and maybe a little less than that.

The table below shows the approximate drop heights (in meters) for each of these
standards, along with bicycle and motorcycle standards for comparison:

| Standard | Flat | Hemi | Curbstone | Max G |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | --------- | ----- |
| [EN 1078](http://js-cct.com/upfile/file/20170901/20170901103322_54247.pdf) (Bicycle) | 1.5 | NA | 1.1 | 250 |
| [CPSC 1203](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2012-title16-vol2/pdf/CFR-2012-title16-vol2-part1203.pdf) (Bicycle) | 2.0 | 1.2 | 1.2 | 300 |
| ASTM F1952 (Downhill) | 2.0 | 1.6 | 1.6 | 300 |
| NTA 8776 (E-bike) | 2.2 | ? | 1.6 | ? |
| [Snell L-98](https://smf.org/standards/l98/L98Std.pdf) (Moped) | 2.4 | 1.6 | 1.6 | 300 |
| [DOT FMVSS 218](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2011-title49-vol6/pdf/CFR-2011-title49-vol6-sec571-218.pdf) (Motorcycle) | 1.8×2 | 1.4×2 | NA | 250[^dot] |
| ECE 22.05 (Motorcycle) | 2.9 | NA | 2.9 | 275 |
| [Snell M2015](https://smf.org/standards/m/2015/M2015FinalFinal.pdf) (Motorcycle) | 3.2×2 | 3.2×2 | NA | 275 |

[^dot]: Technically DOT allows a maximum value of 400g, but in practice their
    more complicated standard is roughly equivalent to requiring a maximum of
    250g, [according to
    research](https://www.6dhelmets.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Comparison-of-test-standards.pdf).
	
Both the DOT and Snell standards require dropping the helmet twice on the same spot.

# Rotation (Mips)

Research shows that brain injuries like concussion can be caused, not only by a
direct impact, but also by sudden rotation. Mips is a company that develops
helmet technology to reduce sudden rotations in a crash, and their products are
widely available in bicycle helmets. Research shows that their technology, as
well as some competing technologies, are successful.[^mips]

[^mips]: See "Impact Performance Comparison of Advanced Bicycle Helmets with
    Dedicated Rotation-Damping Systems"
    ([link](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10439-019-02328-8)), and "A New
    Assessment of Bicycle Helmets: The Brain Injury Mitigation Effects of New
    Technologies in Oblique Impacts"
    ([link](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10439-021-02785-0))

Most of this research is based on bicycle helmets, so it's not clear to what
extent it applies to motorcycle helmets. (Since motorcycle helmets are larger
and heavier, they may rotate less.) However, there are some motorcycle helmets
with Mips available. The new ECE 22.06 standard also includes a rotation test,
which should address these concerns.

# Motorcycle Helmet Certifications

Out of the most common helmet certifications, the European ECE certification
seems to be the closest match to EUC riding. DOT certification is widely
considered to be unreliable, and Snell is known for requiring the highest levels
of impact protection.

DOT
: Terrible. Study show helmets often don't even meet DOT standards.

ECE
: Reasonable.

Snell
: Big on impact protection. A Snell-certified helmet would be a good choice if
  you want to prioritize impact protection over other considerations.

SHARP
: Useful.

# Eye protection

Having dust or bugs fly into your eye at 15mph is pretty uncomfortable, so I
recommend wearing some kind of eye protection if your helmet doesn't have a face
shield.

If you normally wear glasses, they can do a decent job of keeping things out of
your eyes. The downside, though, is that they can shatter in a
crash. Shatterproof cycling glasses are a better solution.

ANSI Z87 certified motorcycle glasses or goggles provide an even higher level of
protection.
