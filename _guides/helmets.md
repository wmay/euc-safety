# Overview

Most experienced EUC riders say that a full face helmet (that is, a helmet with
a chin bar) is the way to go. However, there are multiple types of full face
helmet to choose from, and different types are better suited to different types
of riding and different riding speeds.

There are two main choices to make:

1. Do you want a street or off-road helmet?
1. What level of impact protection do you want? (Motorcycle helmets provide the
   highest level of protection.)

The table below shows the style of helmet corresponding to each combination of
answers:

|              | Non-motorcycle        | Motorcycle                             |
|              | --------------        | ----------                             |
| **Street**   | Downhill longboarding | Standard "full face" motorcycle helmet |
| **Off-road** | Mountain bike         | Motocross                              |

Street helmets are probably better for cooler weather and higher speeds. As for
protection, these are the minimum recommended levels of impact protection based
on riding speed:

| Helmet type               | Speed (mph) | Certifications       |
|---------------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Bicycle                   | <20         | CPSC, EN 1078        |
| Downhill racing or e-bike | 20-28       | ASTM F1952, NTA 8776 |
| Motorcycle                | >28         | DOT, ECE, Snell      |

In terms of safety, the most important feature is helmet certification. The
second most important feature is a technology like MIPS that reduces head
rotation. (It can also help to get a brighter color for [traffic visibility]({{
site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/traffic.md %}).)

The specific type of motorcycle helmet I recommend for most riders is a
dual-sport helmet with ECE certification. The reasoning behind these
recommendations is explained further down.

# Why a full face helmet?

Probably the most common type of EUC crash is a faceplant. This happens when,
for any number of reasons, the wheel loses the ability to keep the rider
upright, and the rider falls straight forward into the ground. The effect is
similar to having a rug pulled out from under you.

A team of researchers at New Imperial College London simulated e-scooter falls
showing how this happens.[^faceplant] These falls are very similar to the EUC
faceplant, and you can see some results below.

[^faceplant]: See [Computational prediction of head-ground impact kinematics in
    e-scooter falls](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2022.106567), or the press
    article summarizing the paper, [E-scooter simulations highlight head injury
    risk to riders from
    falls](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/233378/e-scooter-simulations-highlight-head-injury-risk/).

![Faceplant simulation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/faceplant.gif)

In many cases riders will instinctively put their hands out to prevent hitting
their face, but that doesn't work every time and it's not worth gambling your
face on.

# Street vs off-road

The face shields on street helmets keep bugs/dirt/tree pollen/dust/rain out of
your face better than glasses or goggles can. At higher speeds even rain becomes
surprisingly painful, so this is a big plus.

But the convenience comes with potential downsides, as the face shields also
keep out wind and road noise. Generally, street helmets are less ventilated and
quieter than off-road helmets, and off-road helmets can offer greater peripheral
vision.

**Ventilation:** Due to the face shield blocking airflow, street helmets have
less ventilation than off-road helmets. Off-road helmets are also explicitly
designed to provide more airflow for riders that may be exerting themselves
while riding slowly through tricky terrain.
  
**Noise:** Street helmets are typically designed to be quieter, which is good at
high speeds and around cars, but may be a nuisance at lower speeds and around
relatively quiet bicycles and pedestrians.

**Peripheral vision:** Off-road helmets are made to fit goggles, and as a result
they have larger eye openings that allow the wearer to see more than in
traditional street helmets, at least when not wearing goggles. Off-road helmets
also offer extra *vertical* (downward) vision, which can be useful for seeing
the road near ahead or displays on the wheel. However, bicycle and motorcycle
helmet standards all require a 210° horizontal field of view, so that,
regardless of goggles, peripheral vision in certified helmets isn't obstructed
enough to cause a safety issue. In my opinion, the extra view is a comfort
feature rather than a safety issue.

Dual-sport (aka adventure) helmets are a hybrid of both styles, with the larger
eye openings to allow goggles as well as a face shield for the street. I think
this is a sensible style of motorcycle helmet for most riders.

# How much impact protection?

The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) suggests that bicycle helmets
can be appropriate for motorized scooters with speeds below 20mph (see footnote
4 of [their helmet
guide](https://www.cpsc.gov/safety-education/safety-guides/sports-fitness-and-recreation-bicycles/which-helmet-which-activity)). There
are many full face bicycle helmets, like the Demon Podium and the O'Neal
Backflip, that fall into this category. So, for example, if you ride an InMotion
V8, which has a top speed of 18mph, this kind of helmet is probably fine.

For protection at higher speeds, many riders opt for helmets certified for
downhill mountain bike racing (ASTM F1952). Examples are the Fox Proframe and
the TSG Pass. These helmets are subject to higher impact requirements for the
more dangerous conditions of downhill racing. Since the downhill standard wasn't
intended for the street, it doesn't specify a range of speeds, which has created
some confusion. For example, the
[electric-scooter.guide](https://electric-scooter.guide/safety/ultimate-guide-electric-scooter-helmets/)
website says these helmets are only intended for speeds <20mph, the same as
regular bicycle helmets. Meanwhile Adam from [Wrong
Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppD9gOEudcw&t=274s) suggests they're
appropriate up to 50-60kph (31-37mph).[^wrongway]

[^wrongway]: In the video he only discusses helmets with a regular bicycle
    certification. I'm not sure why he ignores the official downhill
    certification.
	
To clear up the confusion, I compare the downhill standard with two other
standards intermediate between bikes and motorcycles: Snell's L-98 standard for
moped helmets and the Dutch NTA standard for e-bike helmets. The Snell L-98
standard is meant for vehicles traveling below highway speeds, while the NTA
e-bike standard is meant for e-bikes traveling up to 28mph (the legal top speed
for e-bikes in the Netherlands). Unfortunately, as of May 2023, no helmets have
the moped certification, but at least we can use it for comparison. The Beam
Virgo is the only full face helmet I know of with the e-bike certification.

Many helmet standards, including these, use a common impact testing scheme,
which involves dropping a dummy head in a helmet onto an anvil and measuring the
acceleration of the head during the impact. If the acceleration exceeds a
threshold, usually between 250 to 300 G's, then the helmet fails the test. This
video shows a helmet undergoing the certification tests:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oq0BrxVgjEM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The downhill racing, moped, and e-bike standards all have similar impact
requirements. Snell's moped standard seems to have the highest requirements,
followed closely by the NTA e-bike standard, with ASTM's downhill racing
standard slightly below that. Following the NTA's guidance, since the downhill
certification's requirements are slightly lower than e-bike requirements,
downhill helmets would also be appropriate for speeds up to 28mph at the
highest, and maybe a little less than that.

The table below shows the approximate drop heights (in meters) for each of these
standards, along with bicycle and motorcycle standards for comparison:

| Standard                                                                                                                         | Flat    | Hemi    | Curbstone | Max G |

| [Snell M2020D](https://smf.org/standards/m/2020/M2020_Final.pdf) (Motorcycle)                                                    | 3.1+2.6 | 3.1+2.6 | --        | 275   |

Both the DOT and Snell standards require dropping the helmet twice on the same
spot.

Are there downsides to all this impact protection? One potential downside is the
extra weight it requires. But in practice, most people don't seem to mind the
weight and may not even notice it except on some long rides. Another claim, that
the extra weight leads to neck injuries, is not supported by research.[^neck]

[^neck]: For example, see [Motorcycle helmets and cervical spine injuries: a
    5-year experience at a Level 1 trauma
    center](https://doi.org/10.3171/2017.7.SPINE17540).

A more practical downside is that motorcycle helmets are optimized for
motorcycles. In terms of hearing and ventilation, that means they'll be a bit
impractical at slower speeds.

# Rotation (MIPS)

Research shows that brain injuries like concussion can be caused, not only by a
direct impact, but also by sudden rotation. MIPS (Multi-directional Impact
Protection System) is a technology widely available in bicycle helmets, meant to
reduce sudden rotations in a crash. Research shows that MIPS, as well as some
competing technologies, are successful.[^mips]

[^mips]: See "Impact Performance Comparison of Advanced Bicycle Helmets with
    Dedicated Rotation-Damping Systems"
    ([link](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10439-019-02328-8)), "A New Assessment
    of Bicycle Helmets: The Brain Injury Mitigation Effects of New Technologies
    in Oblique Impacts"
    ([link](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10439-021-02785-0)), "The Effect of
    MIPS, Headform Condition, and Impact Orientation on Headform Kinematics
    Across a Range of Impact Speeds During Oblique Bicycle Helmet Impacts"
    ([link](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10439-022-02961-w)), and "Evaluation of two
    rotational helmet technologies to decrease peak rotational acceleration in
    cycling helmets" ([link](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11559-0))

Most of this research is based on bicycle helmets, so it's not clear to what
extent it applies to motorcycle helmets. However, there are some motorcycle
helmets with MIPS available. The new ECE 22.06 standard also includes a rotation
test, which should address these concerns to some extent.

# Motorcycle helmet certifications

The 3 most common motorcycle helmet certifications in the US are DOT, Snell, and
ECE. Oddly enough, Snell and ECE certifications are incompatible with each
other. Experts disagree about which is safest, though it looks to me like most
support ECE over Snell. (Snell introduced a new M2020R standard for Europe that
is compatible with ECE certification. I'm only discussing the original Snell
standard here, which has become M2020D.)

DOT certification does not require independent testing. As a result, I would
only trust DOT certification from established and respected brands.
{: class="warning"}

The main disagreement is about how hard the helmet's impact foam should
be. Harder foam can absorb a harder impact, but provides less cushioning. Snell
takes the position that the foam should be hardened in order to absorb the
hardest impacts. The experts behind the ECE standard argue that harder foam
doesn't provide enough cushioning and causes too many injuries in smaller
impacts, so ECE requires softer foam.

This disagreement is reflected in each standard's test requirements. The table
below shows that ECE has the lowest impact requirements, while Snell has the
highest (the impact energy of two drops add together, so that, for example,
DOT's two drops are roughly like a single 3.6 meter drop). In contrast, ECE has
the strictest head acceleration limits, while Snell is the most permissive. DOT
is in between.

| Standard      | Drop height, flat anvil (m) | max G's (official) | max G's in practice | Head acceleration limiting factor |
|---------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| ECE 22.06     | 3.4                         | 275                | <250[^maxg]         | HIC                               |
| DOT FMVSS 218 | 1.8×2                       | 400                | around 250[^maxg]   | Dwell times                       |
| Snell M2020D  | 3.1+2.6                     | 275                | 275                 | Peak acceleration                 |

[^maxg]: Officially DOT allows a maximum value of 400g, but in practice its
    dwell time requirements imply a maximum of around 250g. See [Conflicts of
    Contemporary Motorcycle Helmet
    Standards](https://smf.org/docs/articles/hic/Conflicts_of_helmet_stds_AAAM_1992.pdf),
    p. 168. ECE adds HIC (head injury criterion) requirements that also imply a
    lower G value. While I couldn't find a rigorous estimate, we can infer
    something from Snell compatibility: many helmets have dual Snell and DOT
    certifications, but practically none are able to meet both Snell
    M2015/M2020D and ECE standards. This implies that ECE's head acceleration
    limits are lower than DOT's. (Snell M2020R adopts the same HIC limits as
    ECE.)

Two arguments lead me to prefer ECE. First, there's reason to believe that a 1.8
meter test drop corresponds to the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile of motorcycle head
impacts, and a 3 meter drop corresponds to the 99<sup>th</sup>
percentile.[^percentiles] The 3.4 meter drop required for ECE certification is
already beyond the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile for motorcycles. Crash speed is
correlated with injury severity,[^speed] and, based on that, I think slower EUC
speeds imply that the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile of EUC head impacts is
significantly lower than that for motorcycles.

[^percentiles]: For the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile estimate, see the Hurt
    report, p. 279. For the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile estimate, see [Comparison
    Tests of Motorcycle Helmets Qualified to International
    Standards](https://msf-usa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/PG1-pdf.pdf), p. 6

[^speed]: See the Hurt report, p. 213-215

Second, I'm not aware of any case of an EUC rider suffering a brain injury due
to inadequate motorcycle helmet foam, at least as of May 2023. This suggests to
me that the extra hardness required by Snell isn't needed for EUCs. In fact, I'm
not aware of any rider even completely compressing the foam of a *bicycle*
helmet. In the US, bicycle helmets are only tested with a 2 meter drop (for CPSC
certification). So my guess is that the ECE impact requirement is adequate.

It's not clear that these issues matter much. The difference is most pronounced
for the rarer hard impacts that are near the limits of what the helmet foam can
absorb, and is probably minor for the smaller head impacts that are much more
common.

A few more notes:

The NHTSA independently tests a small subset of DOT-certified helmets every
year. You can search the NHTSA's helmet test results on their clunky website
[here](https://one.nhtsa.gov/cars/problems/comply/Index.cfm). Unfortunately chin
bars and face shields are not tested for DOT certification.

SHARP and CRASH are two more helmet testing organizations. Both use a 5-star
rating system to evaluate helmets, which can be useful for getting additional
info.

# Eye protection

Having dust or bugs fly into your eye at 15mph is pretty uncomfortable, so I
recommend wearing some kind of eye protection if your helmet doesn't have a face
shield.

If you normally wear glasses, they can do a decent job of keeping things out of
your eyes. The downside, though, is that they can shatter in a
crash. Shatterproof cycling glasses are a better solution.

ANSI Z87 certified motorcycle glasses or goggles provide an even higher level of
protection.
