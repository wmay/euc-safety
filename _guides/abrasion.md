# Rollerblade pads

Skateboard/rollerblade pads are meant to provide abrasion protection along with
impact protection. The European roller sports standard, EN 14120, actually tests
pads for abrasion resistance. Pads certified as CE level 1 must withstand a 16
meter slide against an abrasive belt without wearing through, while CE level 2
pads are subjected to a 64 meter slide.

The biggest limitation of these pads is that they cover a limited surface
area. Only a few common points of impact are protected.

# Hard shell body armor

EUC riders often wear body armor suits like the [Leatt 5.5 Body
Protector](https://leatt.com/us/shop/moto/protection/body-armour/body-protector-5-5-sku-5015400100-W?selected-color=5440)
and [Fox Racing Titan Sport
Jacket](https://www.foxracing.com/product/titan-sport-jacket/24018.html?dwvar_24018_color=001&dwvar_24018_size=S&cgid=mens-moto-gear-guards). It
seems safe to say that this armor provides more abrasion protection than
skateboard pads, for the simple reasons that they have more pads and the pads
cover more surface area.

However, these suits don't get tested for abrasion resistance. Since they're
intended for offroad use, they're only tested for impact protection. That makes
it difficult to say when exactly they can be suitable for the road. The amount
of abrasion protection could also vary widely from one product to another.

The results of a bunch of crashes demonstrate that (at least some of) these body
armor suits provide decent abrasion protection for EUC riding. Still, since they
aren't meant for the road, I can't imagine recommending this type of armor for
speeds over 30mph. If nothing else, the weak fabric holding the pads together
can shred, potentially allowing the pads to fly off and leaving the rider
defenseless against the pavement.

According to [the author at
mcgearhub.com](https://www.mcgearhub.com/motorcycle-pants/best-motorcycle-jeans-guide-updated-reviews/),
class A garments can protect in crashes up to 40mph and class AA up to 75mph.

These speeds are actually higher than the speeds used in testing. Another
consideration, though, is that the pads beneath often provide more protection
after the outer suit is torn (though you are really pushing the garment to its
limits at that point).
