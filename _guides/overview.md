title: "Safety Gear Overview"
---

Choosing safety gear for an electric unicycle isn't straightforward. Partly
that's because there's not much EUC-specific gear available, but partly it's
also because EUCs have a wide range of capabilities and are used for a variety
of types of riding.

My approach to safety gear is to match the type of riding to the most similar
activity, and adopt the gear and recommendations from that activity. For street
riding I think the best matches are downhill longboarding and slower (often
called "urban") motorcycle riding. At slow speeds skateboard and rollerblade
gear can make more sense.

Many experienced riders have also provided advice that I try to incorporate,
often a result of their bad experiences.

Common dangers include

- FOOSH injuries (short for "fall on an outstretched hand"), which are common
  when falling from a standing position. These include wrist, elbow, and
  shoulder injuries.
- Faceplants. The combination of standing, speed, and the design of EUCs make
  this a common type of crash.
- Road rash. Asphalt and skin are not friends.
- Pedal injuries. Because the EUC pedals are attached directly to the wheel they
  can transmit a lot of force, and it's easy to hit your foot or lower leg.

All of these dangers can be dramatically reduced with appropriate gear.
