# Overview

Broken wrists often result when riders fall forward and catch themselves with
their hands-- a common injury for riders without safety gear. Experienced riders
often consider wrist guards to be a requirement for riding. Skate-style wrist
guards provide good protection against these injuries.

After wrist injuries, the most common hand injury is scratching up fingers due
to abrasion with asphalt. This becomes more important at higher speeds. To
combine wrist and hand protection, one option is to wear wrist guards over a
protective glove.[^under] There are also convenient wrist guard/glove
combinations available.

[^under]: I've tried wearing wrist guards *underneath* gloves instead, but it
    doesn't work well. If the gloves don't have built-in palm sliders, then they
    won't slide well. If the gloves do have built-in sliders, then the wrist
    guard underneath pushes the sliders out of place so they may not work
    correctly.

# Wrist protection

Most wrist guards use the following three components (ordered by importance for
a typical EUC forward fall):

1. *Sliders*. Sliders help your wrists slide on the ground, reducing the initial
   impact on your wrists and making hyperextending less likely, especially when
   falling on asphalt.
1. *Bottom splint*. The bottom splint absorbs and redirects the impact, and to
   some extent can keep your wrist from hyperextending. The bottom splint and
   slider are often combined into a single piece.
1. *Top splint*. The top splint keeps your wrist from hyperextending (this one
   is more important for backward falls)

Generally, skate-style wrist guards tend to work the best for EUCs. Other types
of wrist guards, for snowboarding for example, may not include sliders or bottom
splints.

In Europe wrist guards are CE certified under the EN 14120 roller sports
standard. The standard includes 2 levels-- level 1 for "normal roller sports"
and level 2 for "acrobatic roller sports". I don't know of any wrist guard
certified as level 2.

The Demon Flexmeter is supposed to be the safest wrist guard, at least according
to its designers. However I don't know of any systematic evidence demonstrating
this. In theory wrist guards could be compared using their CE certification test
results, but Demon seems to have lost the Flexmeter test results.

# Combined glove and wrist guard options

Gloves with wrist guards aren't too common, but there are a few. The most
protective options are skate-style gloves or purpose-made gloves for EUC and
Onewheel, though some motorcycle gloves also have decent wrist protection.

## Skate, e-skate, and EUC/Onewheel gloves

[Hillbilly](https://e-rides.com/product/hillbilly-full-finger-gloves/) and
[GyroRiderz](https://www.gyroriderz.com/products/gants-gyroriderz-avec-proteges-poignets-integres-2-0?lang=en)
gloves both combine full skate-style wrist guards with abrasion resistant
gloves. This is an ideal combination for a lot of EUC riding, so these gloves
are widely used. f(x)nction's [Sender wrist
guards](https://shop.fxnctiongear.com/products/fxnction-shredder-wrist-guards-full-finger)
are similar, but without the top splint.

E-skate gloves require more flexibility (to hold an e-skate remote), but often
still include wrist protection. flatland3d's [Carbon E-Skate
Gloves](https://flatland3d.com/shop/all-products/all-e-skate-accessories/carbon-e-skate-glove)
have both Knox palm sliders and a flexible top splint. The palm sliders allow
hands to move more but don't protect as much as a skate-style wrist guard.

## Motorcycle gloves

Some motorcycle gloves have palm sliders meant to prevent wrist
injuries. [Knox](https://www.planet-knox.com/) in particular is known for making
good palm sliders. Motorcycle gloves don't include either a top or bottom splint
because motorcyclists need to flex their wrists.

Despite lower levels of wrist protection, a possible benefit of motorcycle
gloves is that you can get higher levels of abrasion resistance. EN 13594 is the
relevant CE standard. Gloves can be certified as level 1 or level 2. For EUCs
level 1 is probably adequate, though I haven't yet found all the details of the
standard.
  
Many motorcycle gloves also offer knuckle or finger impact protection, but this
is a lower priority for EUC.
