# Overview

Car drivers make mistakes all the time. Some are inexperienced, some are
distracted, and some are literally on drugs. And getting hit by a car is one of
the worst things that can happen on a unicycle. Drivers' mistakes are
predictable, though, and motorcyclists and cyclists have developed all sorts of
strategies to deal with them.

One major issue is that drivers often fail to notice small vehicles, so it can
help to make yourself more conspicuous with bright colors and lights. Defensive
riding habits can also make a huge difference. And there are a bunch of
miscellaneous actions a rider can take to make street riding safer or less
risky.

# Visibility

Often drivers aren't looking for smaller vehicles, and this is the source of
many crashes. You can increase the odds of being seen by wearing bright colors,
lights, and retroreflective materials.

<!-- "two-thirds of motorcycle-car crashes occurred when the car driver failed to see -->
<!-- the approaching motorcycle and violated the rider's right-of-way" -->
<!-- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurt_Report#Findings> -->

Bright colors tend to attract attention. During daytime, the typical human eye
is most sensitive to yellow-green (<span style="color:#B3FF00">██</span>, aka
chartreuse), so this color is often used for high visibility gear. In motorcycle
gear, it's often just called "hi-viz". During low-light conditions, a slightly
blue-ish green color (<span style="color:#00FF38">██</span>) is the most
visible.[^chartreuse] <!-- Fluorescent materials can be even brighter by absorbing -->
<!-- non-visible light and emitting it as visible light, though they generally -->
<!-- require daylight to work. -->

A high visibility safety vest might be the easiest way to add bright
colors. There's also all sorts of bicycle and motorcycle gear in these
colors. But even wearing white instead of black can improve visibility.

[^chartreuse]: This is according to the CIE, an international organization that
    produces some technical color standards. It comes from their photopic and
    scotopic luminous efficiency functions, which peak at wavelengths of 555nm
    and 507nm, respectively.

Retroflective materials reflect light back in the direction of the light
source. At night they reflect the light back from car headlights, making you
much more visible to drivers. Motorcycle clothing often comes with
retroreflective elements. Retroreflective tape is also pretty cheap and can be
added to helmets, wheels, and other gear.

For lights, I recommend a red rear light and a white front light, since drivers
are familiar with those. Blinking lights are often more conspicuous than steady
lights.[^blinking] Even in the daytime, lights can prevent crashes for both
bicyclists and motorcyclists.[^daytime]

[^blinking]: "The Conspicuity Benefits of Dynamic and Static Bicycle Taillights
    at Night," <https://doi.org/10.1177/1541931213601755>

[^daytime]: "The Effects of Motor Vehicle Fleet Daytime Running Lights (DRL) on
    Motorcycle Conspicuity"

    effects of permanent running lights for bicycles: A controlled experiment"
    ([link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2012.07.006))

Lumens is a common measure of the brightness of a light. This table shows
typical lumens values for traffic applications:

| Type of light               | lumens  |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| To be seen (rear and front) | 50-200  |
| To see (front only)         | 500-800 |
| Car headlight               | 1500    |

Third-party sellers on sites like Amazon and AliExpress often lie about the
performance of their lights.

Research confirms that these strategies are effective. A meta-study from 2006
(updated in 2009) finds that

> Fluorescent materials in yellow, red and orange colours improve detection and
> recognition in the daytime. For night‐time visibility, lamps, flashing lights
> and retroreflective materials in red and yellow colours increase detection and
> recognition.[^kwan]

    prevention of death and injuries,"
    <https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003438.pub2>

In 2012 to 2013, researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial of 6793
cyclists in Denmark to find the effect of wearing a high visibility jacket with
retroreflective elements. They estimate that wearing the jacket reduced
accidents with other road users by 38%.[^lahrmann2]

# Defensive riding

There are all sorts of defensive riding tips for cyclists and
motorcyclists. Many of the tips apply to both riders. I only split them up here
for the sake of organization.

## Bicycle tips

These tips generally apply to people riding on the side of the road and in bike
lanes.

*Dooring.* Avoid riding close to parked cars to avoid colliding with a car door
that unexpectedly opens.

*Right hook.* Drivers turning right often fail to check for cyclists riding to
their right, and may turn into you at an intersection. A simple way to avoid
this is to take the lane while riding through the intersection, even if there's
a bike lane. (For countries that drive on the left side of the road, it's a left
hook.)

*Take the lane.* When it's not safe for a car to pass, "take the lane" by moving
to the middle or inside portion of the lane, as opposed to the outer portion
where bikes normally ride. This prevents cars from passing, or at least requires
them to change lanes to pass. I often find taking the lane useful at
intersections where passing can become confusing and chaotic.

*Avoid large vehicles.* Large vehicles like buses and 18-wheelers are especially
dangerous. They may have more blind spots, and turn in ways that can be
difficult to predict. See [this video](https://youtu.be/SqmBgjS5klo) from the
Chicago DOT for more details on buses and bikes.

## Motorcycle and scooter tips

These tips apply more to people riding with traffic. Ken Whitehouse from Honda
Australia Rider Training gives a good overview:

*Lane position.* A single lane for a car is the equivalent of 3 or more "lanes"
for a motorcycle or EUC. Choose lane positions to increase your visibility to
other road users and to create a space buffer between yourself and road hazards.

*Don't tailgate.* EUCs cannot brake as fast as cars can. Leave room to allow
yourself to stop without hitting the vehicle in front of you.

*Blind spots.* Don't ride next to a car in the car's blind spots, which are
usually directly beside the car and slightly behind the driver. If you can't see
the driver in one of the car's mirrors, then you are in a blind spot.

*Left turning cars (left cross).* The most frequent cause of motorcycle-car
collisions is a car going the opposite direction turning left in front of the
motorcyclist.[^leftturn] The same also happens to cyclists, who have named it
the "left cross." Be cautious around cars waiting to turn left. (For countries
that drive on the left side of the road, it's a right cross.)

[^leftturn]: Hurt report, p. 46-47

*Sunrise/sunset.* The sun blinds a lot of drivers around sunrise and sunset. If
the sun is blinding you, it will blind other drivers moving in your
direction. If you cast a long shadow ahead of you, drivers moving toward you may
be blinded.

*Ride like you're invisible.* There's never a guarantee that a driver has seen
you (or that a driver will take the correct action even if they do see you),
even if you make eye contact. Ride with the assumption that they haven't seen
you.

*Escape route.* Position yourself so that you have an easy escape route if a
vehicle moves dangerously toward you.

# Should you...

## Run red lights? (Idaho stop)

There's a popular theory among cyclists that you should run red lights in order
to pull away from the stopped traffic. Meanwhile, an opposed group of road users
assume that running a light must be dangerous.

A version of this became legal in Idaho in 1982, so that it's now called the
Idaho stop. The law allows Idaho cyclists to treat a red light as a stop sign,
and a stop sign as a yield. Some preliminary evidence suggests that the law did
not lead to more bike accidents, and may even have prevented them.[^idaho]
However, the various "studies" I've seen on this topic are informal and not
published in peer-reviewed journals, so I don't put a lot of weight on these
results. In any case, data does not show that the Idaho stop is obviously
dangerous.

[^idaho]: "Bicycle Safety and Choice: Compounded Public Cobenefits of the Idaho
    Law Relaxing Stop Requirements for Cycling" (a self-published study from a
    public health professional)
    ([link](https://meggsreport.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/idaho-law-jasonmeggs-2010version-2.pdf)),
    "Delaware Yield Crash Data"
    ([link](https://www.bikede.org/delaware-yield-crash-data/))

## Ride on the sidewalk?

It's been found repeatedly that bicycle accidents are more likely on the
sidewalk than on the street.[^sidewalks] The main issue is that drivers don't
watch for vehicles on sidewalks. Another issue, in my experience, is that many
sidewalks are more poorly maintained than the street. It's also illegal in many
US cities.

[^sidewalks]: See "Risk Factors for Bicycle-Motor Vehicle Collisions at
    Intersections"
    ([link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210422222536/http://www.bicyclinglife.com/Library/Accident-Study.pdf)),
    "Survey of North American Bicycle Commuters: Design and Aggregate Results"
    ([link](https://doi.org/10.3141/1578-12)), "Adult Bicyclists in the United
    States: Characteristics and Riding Experience in 1996"
    ([link](https://doi.org/10.3141/1636-01)), "Sidewalk Bicycling Safety
    Issues" ([link](https://doi.org/10.3141/1636-11))

But this is an aggregate finding that doesn't necessarily apply to every street
and every cyclist (or unicyclist). One set of researchers summarizes it this
way:

> While average event rates on sidewalks may be higher than similar event rates
> on roads or paths, simply educating cyclists to stop cycling on sidewalks may
> not be prudent as these cyclists have higher event rates on roads than
> non-sidewalk cyclists. ... It is reasonable to suggest that more experienced
> cyclists are more comfortable with vehicular traffic or have learned by
> experience where the hazards lie. Whatever the reasons, sidewalk cyclists
> should not simply be educated that sidewalk cycling is dangerous and should
> therefore be discontinued.[^sidewalks-quote]

[^sidewalks-quote]: From "Sidewalk Bicycling Safety Issues"

Basically, riders who start on the sidewalk should increasingly use the street
as they become more familiar with local traffic.

Both the League of American Bicyclists ([here](https://youtu.be/1icY11n7Tzk))
and BikeSafe ([here](https://youtu.be/j-mFhO4scPQ)) have advice for safely
riding on sidewalks.

## Lane-split / filter?

Lane-splitting, usually referring to motorcycles, is riding between car lanes on
a multiple-lane road. Lane-filtering is a similar term, but refers specifically
to riding between stopped traffic. Some motorcyclists advocate lane-filtering at
stoplights, with the argument that it reduces the chance of getting rear-ended.

SMARTER, a motorcyclist association promoting safe riding, published the best
overview of the evidence I've seen
[here](https://smarter-usa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Motorcycle-Lane-splitting-filtering-An-Overview-of-the-Literature-2010-2020-March-2021.pdf).
Very few studies directly examine this question. While one study (in California)
finds that lane-splitters are significantly less likely be in a crash, two
studies (in France) find that it increases the odds of a crash. It isn't clear
to me what to conclude based on this limited research.

# Misc.

## Know the roads

An easy way to avoid problems is to avoid riding when and where problems tend to
happen.

There's often a lot of aggressive traffic around rush hour. Drunk drivers are
more likely to be on the streets late Friday and Saturday nights/early
mornings. Some small neighborhood roads can have surprisingly aggressive traffic
if people use them to cut through the neighborhood.

Special events that draw people from out of town can create hazards. For
example, my area has a few colleges, and on the days of college graduation
ceremonies the roads become much more chaotic than usual.

<!-- And potholes tend to appear in the spring (due to freezing and thawing). -->

## Braking

The faster you can brake, the better. If you have a larger wheel that's more
difficult to slow down, it's good to have power pads to help. Also practice the
technique where you pull back on the front of the wheel with your hand to
decelerate faster.

<!-- practice curb jumps? high speed swerving? -->

## Mirror, horn, and turn signals

Rearview mirrors are very useful in traffic. EUC riders can get one attached to
their helmet or on their wrist. I recommend them to everyone riding on the
street.

A horn can also come in handy now and then (for example, if a car starts to
merge into your lane, or pull out in front of you). Electric horns made for
bicycles can work well, and some EUC apps have horn capabilities too.

There are some turn signal lights made for cyclists, but they aren't strictly
needed. Since our hands are free on a unicycle, we can use the bicycle hand
signals.

## Insurance and legal issues

If you find yourself having negative interactions with drivers, some kind of
action or dash cam may be useful. I've found that a police-style bodycam works
well for this. Cameras won't necessarily capture license plate numbers, but at
least you have evidence to provide to the police.

If you live in the US, consider increasing your uninsured motorist coverage:

But getting an insurance payout could be tricky if you live in a state where
EUCs are not officially street legal, which is the case in most of the US.
