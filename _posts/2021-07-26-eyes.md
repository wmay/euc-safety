slow speeds: cycling glasses

faster: motorcycle glasses or goggles?

ANSI Z87: impact etc.

| Helmet type | Speed (mph) | Standard |
| ----------- | ----------- | --- |
| Bicycle      | <20       | CPSC / ASTM F1447, EN 1078 |
| Downhill Longboard or urban motorcycle glove | 20-40? | ASTM F1952 |
| Motorcycle glove  | >40?   | EN 13594 level 1 |

avoid glass glasses because they can shatter (though hopefully full face helmet
will also keep that from happening)
