title: "Safety Gear Overview"
---

Choosing safety gear for an electric unicycle isn't straightforward. Partly
that's because there's not much EUC-specific gear available, but partly it's
also because EUCs have a wide range of capabilities and are used for a variety
of types of riding.

My approach to safety gear is to match the type of riding to the most similar
activity, and adopt the gear and recommendations from that activity.

For most riding I think the best matches are downhill longboarding and
urban-style motorcycle gear. Mountain bike and motocross gear are also close,
especially for off-road riding. At slower speeds skateboard and rollerblade gear
can make more sense.

There are two aspects of EUC injuries that don't map well onto these categories,
and these require special consideration:

1. EUC riders have especially hard forward falls. When the EUC abruptly stops,
   the effect is like having a rug pulled out from under you, resulting in a
   hard landing on your upper body. This means, for example, that it's important
   to get a full face helmet to protect your face.
1. EUC pedals pack a serious punch. Because they're attached directly to the
   wheel they can transmit a lot of force, and it's easy to hit your foot or
   lower leg. Possible injuries range from annoying minor scrapes all the way to
   a severed Achilles tendon.
   
Many experienced riders have also provided advice that I try to incorporate,
sometimes a result of their bad experiences.

# Common falls

The most common fall is the classic forward fall. ... protect wrists and hands ...

Can also get twisted (pedal clip) and hit ribs. Or even worse, land on shoulder.

Backwards falls less likely.
