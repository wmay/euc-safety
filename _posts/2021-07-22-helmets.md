# Overview

Most experienced EUC riders say that a full face helmet (that is, a helmet with
a chin bar) is the way to go. However, there are multiple types of full face
helmet to choose from, and different types are better suited to different types
of riding and different riding speeds.

There are two main choices to make:

1. Do you want an on-road-style visor?
1. What level of protection do you want?

The table below shows the style of helmet corresponding to each combination of
answers:

| | Non-motorcycle | Motorcycle |
|-|----------------|------------|
| **On-road** | Downhill longboarding | On-road motorcycle |
| **Off-road** | Mountain bike | Motocross |

[brief summary of how to choose]

# On-road vs off-road

On-road visors keep out more bugs/dirt/tree pollen/dust/rain out of your face
than glasses or goggles can. At higher speeds even rain becomes surprisingly
painful, so this is a big plus.

But the convenience comes with potential downsides, as the visors also keep out
wind and road noise. Generally, on-road helmets are

- Hotter: Due to the visor blocking airflow, on-road helmets get hotter than
  off-road helmets.
- Quieter: (hearing research)
- peripheral vision?

Basically, on-road helmets are probably better for cooler weather and higher
speeds.

# How much protection?

depends on speed and traffic. At above bicycle speeds it's very likely that
motorcycle helmets are safer

considerations:

- weight (neck injury research)

Riding speed is the most important factor when choosing among different
types. The table below suggests the appropriate EUC helmet type at different
speeds.

| Helmet type | Speed (mph) | Standards |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Bicycle | <20 | CPSC, EN 1078 |
| Downhill Mountain Bike Racing | 20-30? | ASTM F1952 |
| Motorcycle | >30? | DOT, ECE, Snell, SHARP |

The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) suggests that bicycle helmets
can be appropriate for motorized scooters moving slower than 20mph (see footnote
4 of [their helmet
guide](https://www.cpsc.gov/safety-education/safety-guides/sports-fitness-and-recreation-bicycles/which-helmet-which-activity)). There
are many full face bicycle helmets, like the Demon Podium and the O'Neil
Backflip, that fall into this category. So, for example, if you ride an InMotion
V8, which has a top speed of 18mph, this kind of helmet is probably fine.

For protection at higher speeds, many riders opt for helmets certified for
downhill mountain bike racing (ASTM F1952). These helmets are subject to higher
impact requirements and are meant for the faster speeds of downhill racers. The
downhill standard doesn't explicitly specify a range of speeds, though, which
has created some confusion. For example, the
[electric-scooter.guide](https://electric-scooter.guide/safety/ultimate-guide-electric-scooter-helmets/)
website says these helmets are only intended for speeds <20mph, the same as
regular bicycle helmets. Meanwhile Adam from [Wrong
Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppD9gOEudcw&t=274s) suggests they're
appropriate up to 50-60kph (31-37mph).[^wrongway]

[^wrongway]: In the video he only discusses helmets with a regular bicycle
    rating. I'm not sure why he omits downhill-rated helmets.
	
Here's my method for deciding the speed range:

First, I found that Snell has a helmet standard,
[L-98](https://smf.org/standards/l98/L98Std.pdf), meant for "Low Powered
Vehicles, Mopeds, and Motorized Bicycles". It sounds like the ideal standard for
faster EUC riding. The standard is meant for vehicles traveling below highway
speeds, which I interpret as <50mph. Unfortunately no helmets are currently
certified to this standard. However, this standard just so happens to be very
similar to ASTM's downhill racing standard.

In fact, two of the three impact test requirements are identical between these
two standards. To me, that implies that downhill-rated helmets are close to
being Snell certified moped helmets good up to 50mph. The remaining test is
easier for the downhill certification. To account for that I bumped the downhill
speed down from 50 to 40mph.

The table below shows the approximate drop heights (in meters) for 

| Standard | Flat | Hemi | Curbstone | Max G |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | --------- | ----- |
| EN 1078 (Bicycle) | 1.5 | NA | 1.1 | 250 |
| CPSC 1203 (Bicycle) | 2.0 | 1.2 | 1.2 | 300 |
| ASTM F1952 (Downhill) | 2.0 | 1.6 | 1.6 | 300 |
| NTA 8776 (E-bike) | 2.2 | ? | 1.6 | ? |
| [Snell L-98](https://smf.org/standards/l98/L98Std.pdf) (Moped) | 2.4 | 1.6 | 1.6 | 300 |
| [DOT FMVSS 218](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2011-title49-vol6/pdf/CFR-2011-title49-vol6-sec571-218.pdf) (Motorcycle) | 1.8×2 | 1.4×2 | NA | 250[^dot] |
| ECE 22.05 (Motorcycle) | 2.9 | NA | 2.9 | 275 |
| [Snell M2015](https://smf.org/standards/m/2015/M2015FinalFinal.pdf) (Motorcycle) | 3.2×2 | 3.2×2 | NA | 275 |

[^dot]: Technically DOT allows a maximum value of 400g, but in practice their
    more complicated standard is roughly equivalent to requiring a maximum of
    250g, [according to
    research](https://www.6dhelmets.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Comparison-of-test-standards.pdf).

Not directly comparable due to some allowing multiple hits.

NTA 8776: [20% more than EN
1078](https://www.galaxus.ch/en/page/key-bike-helmet-considerations-11467). [Bern
helmets](https://www.bernhelmets.com/pages/bern-faq#safety) says it's supposed
to be safe up to 28mph / 45kph, which is the legal top speed for a speed pedelec
in many places.

A second line of evidence is the crash experiences described in the EUC forums,
where downhill helmets have generally held up during higher speed crashes.

I think 40mph is a reasonable guess for where the threshold should be. At this
speed threshold, only the fastest EUC riders today need to consider motorcycle
helmets.

The Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute describes the downhill certification
requirements [here](https://helmets.org/f1952standard.htm).

# Downhill, Mountain Bike vs Longboard

Longboard examples: TSG Pass, Predator DH6-Xg, Triple 8 Racer, New Olders Avitar
v2. Out of these, only the TSG Pass is officially certified as a downhill
helmet, but it's not clear if that's because they would be unable to pass or if
they don't consider the mountain bike standard to be relevant for longboarding.

# Rotation (MIPS)

get MIPS people

# Are motorcycle helmets safer?

They offer higher impact protection but aren't necessarily safer due to the
additional weight.

might choose one anyway for other reasons such as looks and visor systems.

Snell has been criticized for requirements that ... bulky, so DOT and ECE are
probably the more relevant standards for EUCs.

ISI / IS 4151 (India)

recommendations: Kali ... (motocross style), Klim Krios (dual-sport style), Steelbird Air 2
