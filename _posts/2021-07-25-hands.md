options-- wrist guard over gloves, hillbilly gloves, motorcycle gloves

after wrist injuries, the most common hand injury is scratching up fingers.

prioritizing--

- wrist protection
- hand abrasion protection
- hand impact protection

the wrist protection stays pretty much the same over different speeds, but glove abrasion resistance becomes more important

impact protection for knuckles/fingers?

EN 388-- the European standard used to evaluate mechanical risks for hand
protection. Gloves with a EN 388 rating are third party tested, and rated for
abrasion, cut, tear, and puncture resistance.

ANSI/ISEA 105-- 

ANSI/ISEA 138-- knuckle/finger impact protection?

EN 13594-- motorcycle standard related to EN 388?

Downhill Longboard Gloves provide pretty good abrasion protection, especially
when paired with a wrist guard. (Hillbilly's wrist guard gloves are very similar
to Triple 8's downhill longboard gloves, just with a wrist guard attached.)
