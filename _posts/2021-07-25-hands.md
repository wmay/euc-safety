# Overview

Due to riders falling forward and catching themselves with their hands, broken
wrists are a common EUC injury-- possibly the most common injury for riders
without safety gear. Experienced riders often consider wrist guards to be a
requirement for riding.

After wrist injuries, the most common hand injury is scratching up fingers due
to abrasion with asphalt. Many protective gloves also offer knuckle or finger
impact protection, but this is a lower priority for EUC.

At higher speeds, abrasion protection becomes more important. To combine wrist
and hand protection, one option is to wear wrist guards over a protective
glove.[^under] There are also convenient wrist guard/glove combinations
available.

[^under]: I've tried wearing wrist guards *underneath* gloves instead, but it
    doesn't work well. If the gloves don't have built-in palm sliders, then they
    won't slide well. If the gloves do have built-in sliders, then the wrist
    guard underneath pushes the sliders out of place so they don't work
    correctly.

# Wrist protection

Most wrist guards use the following three components (ordered by importance for
a typical EUC forward fall):

1. *Sliders*. Sliders help your wrists slide on the ground, reducing the initial
   impact on your wrists and making hyperextending less likely, especially when
   falling on asphalt.
1. *Bottom splint*. The bottom splint absorbs and redirects the impact, and to
   some extent can keep your wrist from hyperextending. The bottom splint and
   slider are often combined into a single piece.
1. *Top splint*. The top splint keeps your wrist from hyperextending (this one
   is more important for backward falls)

Not all wrist guards are equal. Skateboard/rollerblade-style wrist guards tend
to work the best for EUCs. Some other wrist guards, for snowboarding for
example, may not include sliders or bottom splints.

In Europe wrist guards are CE certified under the EN 14120 roller sports
standard. The standard includes 2 levels-- level 1 for "normal roller sports"
and level 2 for "acrobatic roller sports". I don't know of any wrist guard
certified as level 2.

The Demon Flexmeter is supposed to be the safest wrist guard, at least according
to its designers. However I don't know of any systematic evidence demonstrating
this. In theory wrist guards could be compared using their CE certification test
results, but Demon seems to have lost the Flexmeter test results.

# Glove/wrist guard options

Gloves with wrist guards aren't too common, but there are a few options. They're
ordered here from most to least wrist protection.

Hillbilly wrist guard gloves, GyroRiderz gloves

: These gloves combine skateboard-style wrist guards with abrasion resistant
  gloves. This is an ideal combination for a lot of EUC riding, so these gloves
  are widely used.

flatland3d e-skate gloves

: These are similar to the Hillbilly or GyroRiderz gloves, but they replace the
  bottom wrist guard splint with Knox palm sliders. The palm sliders probably
  don't protect as much as a skateboard-style wrist guard, but they allow you to
  move your hand more (for example, to hold an e-skate remote).

Motorcycle gloves

: Some motorcycle gloves have palm sliders meant to prevent wrist
  injuries. (Knox in particular is known for making palm sliders.) Motorcycle
  gloves don't include either a top or bottom splint because motorcyclists need
  to move their wrists.

  Despite lower levels of wrist protection, a possible benefit of motorcycle
  gloves is that you can get higher levels of abrasion resistance. EN 13594 is
  the relevant CE standard. Gloves can be certified as level 1 or level 2. For
  EUCs level 1 is probably adequate, though I haven't yet found all the details
  of the standard.
