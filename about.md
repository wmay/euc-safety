This website is just an attempt to organize my safety gear notes into something
that's useful for other people. (I guess I watched too many youtube videos about
crashes and injuries.)

There's a lot of information to cover for this topic, so I'm open to suggestions
and pointers to useful info. The best way to suggest a change is to open an
issue on the [github repository](https://github.com/wmay/euc-safety/issues), or
send me an email. Obviously I won't be able to agree with every rider on every
issue, but I'll at least try to correct factual errors and include important
issues that I might have missed.
