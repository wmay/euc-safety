What kind of protective gear do you need to stay safe on an electric unicycle?
This website is just a collection of my notes on these issues. I hope it's
helpful.

Currently there's [an overview]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/overview.md
%}), with comments on how to choose gear and what to protect against, and a
[helmets page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/helmets.md %}) is mostly
complete. [Wrist guards]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/hands.md %}) are
strongly recommended. It's a good idea to wear knee, elbow and other [impact
protectors]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/impact.md %}), and it's also a
good idea to protect your [feet]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/feet.md %}).

A page on [abrasion resistance]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/abrasion.md
%}) (protection from road rash) is in progress.
