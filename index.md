What kind of protective gear do you need to stay safe on an electric unicycle?
This website is just a collection of my notes on these issues. I hope it's
helpful.

Currently there's [an overview]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url
2021-07-24-overview %}), with comments on how to choose gear and what to protect
against, and a [helmets page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-07-22-helmets
%}) is partly complete. [Wrist guards]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url
2021-07-25-hands %}) are strongly recommended. It's also a good idea to wear
knee, elbow and other [impact protectors]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url
2021-09-24-impact %}).

Pages on abrasion resistance (protection from road rash) and foot gear are
planned but not ready yet.

**Disclaimer: This site is a work in progress. Relevant information is probably
missing and some details may even be incorrect. Take these recommendations with
a grain of salt.**
