So you've seen some videos of electric unicycle crashes, and heard about broken
ribs and shoulders and other serious injuries. What kind of protective gear
do you need to stay safe and how do you keep this from happening to you?

This website is just a collection of my notes on these issues. I hope it's
helpful.

**Disclaimer: While I'm hoping to turn this website into a comprehensive and
reliable guide to EUC safety gear, I don't think it's there yet. Relevant
information is probably missing and some details may even be incorrect, so take
these recommendations with a grain of salt.**
