What protective gear do you need to stay safe on an electric unicycle? This
website started as a collection of my notes on these issues, that I decided to
organize and share.

[An overview]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/overview.md %}) describes my
approach to safety gear and what to protect against.

Then, the links here lead to a short guide for each type of gear:

- **Essential:** a [helmet]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/helmets.md %}) and
  [wrist guards]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/hands.md %}).
- **Recommended:** knee, elbow and other [impact protectors]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/impact.md %}). And when not going slow,
  [road rash protection]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/abrasion.md %}).
- **Good to have:** [foot protection]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/feet.md %}).

And one more-- a [battery safety guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
_guides/batteries.md %}), since the lithium-ion batteries in most wheels can be
a fire hazard.

While I've done an embarrassing amount of research to make this, I obviously
can't guarantee anyone's safety, so this [legal disclaimer]({{ site.baseurl }}{%
link disclaimer.md %}) explains that I'm not responsible if something goes
wrong.
