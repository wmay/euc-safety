What kind of protective gear do you need to stay safe on an electric unicycle?
This website is just a collection of my notes on these issues. I hope it's
helpful.

Currently there's [an overview]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/overview.md
%}) with comments on how to choose gear and what to protect against. A
[helmet]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/helmets.md %}) and [wrist guards]({{
site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/hands.md %}) are essential. It's a good idea to
wear knee, elbow and other [impact protectors]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
_guides/impact.md %}), and it's also a good idea to protect your [feet]({{
site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/feet.md %}). When riding on the street, you can
protect against road rash with [abrasion resistant gear]({{ site.baseurl }}{%
link _guides/abrasion.md %}).

Since the lithium-ion batteries in most wheels can be a fire hazard, there's
also a [battery safety guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _guides/batteries.md
%}).
