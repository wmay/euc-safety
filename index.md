So you've seen some videos of electric unicycle crashes, and heard about broken
ribs and shoulders and other serious injuries. What kind of protective gear
do you need to stay safe and how do you keep this from happening to you?

This website is just a collection of my notes on these issues. I hope it's
helpful.

Currently there's [an overview]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url
2021-07-24-overview %}), with comments on how to choose gear and what to protect
against, and a [helmets page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-07-22-helmets
%}) is partly complete. A page on [limb/torso impact protection]({{ site.baseurl
}}{% post_url 2021-09-24-limbs %}) is coming together but still a bit messy.

**Disclaimer: This site is a work in progress. Relevant information is probably
missing and some details may even be incorrect. Take these recommendations with
a grain of salt.**
